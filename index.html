          <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
          <p>In this tiny ebook I&rsquo;m going to show you how to get started writing 6502 assembly language. The 6502 processor was massive in the seventies and eighties, powering famous computers like the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a>,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment
              System</a>. Bender in Futurama <a href="http://www.transbyte.org/SID/SID-files/Bender_6502.jpg">has a 6502 processor for a
              brain</a>. <a href="http://www.pagetable.com/docs/terminator/00-37-23.jpg">Even the
              Terminator was programmed in
              6502</a>.</p>

          <p>So, why would you want to learn 6502? It&rsquo;s a dead language isn&rsquo;t it? Well, so&rsquo;s Latin. And they still teach that.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.">Q.E.D.</a></p>

          <p>(Actually, I&rsquo;ve been reliably informed that 6502 processors are still being produced by <a href="http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c02s-chip.cfm">Western Design Center</a> and <a href="http://www.mouser.co.uk/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=65C02">sold to hobbyists</a>,
            so clearly 6502
            <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a dead language! Who knew?)</p>

          <p>Seriously though, I think it&rsquo;s valuable to have an understanding of assembly language. Assembly language is the lowest level of abstraction in computers - the point at which the code is still readable. Assembly language translates directly
            to the bytes that are executed by your computer&rsquo;s processor. If you understand how it works, you&rsquo;ve basically become a computer
            <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/04/magic-in-software-development/">magician</a>.</p>

          <p>Then why 6502? Why not a <em>useful</em> assembly language, like
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a>? Well, I don&rsquo;t think learning x86 is useful. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever have to <em>write</em> assembly language in your day job - this is purely an academic exercise, something
            to expand your mind and your thinking. 6502 was originally written in a different age, a time when the majority of developers were writing assembly directly, rather than in these new-fangled high-level programming languages. So, it was designed
            to be written by humans. More modern assembly languages are meant to written by compilers, so let&rsquo;s leave it to them. Plus, 6502 is <em>fun</em>. Nobody ever called x86 <em>fun</em>.</p>
